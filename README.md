# A Bit of Focus

A straightforward Pomodoro timer designed as a Single Page Application Progressive Web App (SPA PWA). It's intended for larger screens and is ideal for classroom use. It randomly showcases images or quotes during both breaks and Pomodoro sessions.

Configuration is possible via a dynamically included JSON file.

Configuration options comprise:

* Sequence of Pomodoros and breaks for the current day
* Initial start time for the first Pomodoro in the sequence
* Sounds for initiating and concluding Pomodoros or breaks
* Adding HTML content to any segment

Have fun,
